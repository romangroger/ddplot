# ddplot

Visualization of distortions of crystals containing dislocations using the differential displacement maps. Both screw and edge view are implemented, comparison of two different distortions, geometrical transforms, user-defined styles. Imports data in a variety of formats, exports to Postscript, bitmap and internal .dd formats. The change in the separations of neighboring atoms is depicted by arrows whose lengths correspond to the magnitudes of the changes of their separation relative to their distance in the ideal crystal.
